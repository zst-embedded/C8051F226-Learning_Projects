**Note:** 
- *Exercises are those stated in the lab sheet, whereas bonus codes are those thought of on the spot.*
- *Lab 2 and 3 were lessons on bitwise operations in standard C programming. Hence, they were not included.*


**To compile:**
- *Add all files in the [`./dependencies`](./dependencies) folder, along with the desired code file.*
